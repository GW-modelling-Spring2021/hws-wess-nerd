Good start on this!

1. Really good answer ... maybe just flesh out a bit why, exactly, the flow varies as it
does along both boundaries.  Relate it to distance from the well.

2. Good discussion.  One question, what is the direction of flow directly downgradient of
the well as shown by the flow transec there?  Why?

3. Good answer!  Be a little careful of your capture zone.  Does it extend to the left
boundary?  What about the right boundary?

4. Really good.  You corrected for the axis scales, so the drawdown IS circular near the
well.  It becomes oblong farther away.  For this, can you explain the combined effect of
both the no flow and constant head boundaries?  How could you check your supposition
that the background gradient is affecting the drawdown?

5. Spot on.
