Excellent work ... 95%!  I'm going to nitpick slightly.  Be careful of thinking
of there being a 'buildup of water' in the confined case.  Remember that the
specific storage is TINY.  There can be a large pressure build up with very
little build up of stored water.  I'd like for you to try to calculate the
relative contributions of ag irrigation and the boundary flow to the well.
