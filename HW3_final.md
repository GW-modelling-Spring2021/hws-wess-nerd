Nice work on this, David - 95%!  You did an excellent job - very clearly written, very complete analyses ... until the very last part of the last question.  Maybe rethink how you would test whether absolute or relative K contrasts control the head distribution!

Can you resend me (by email) your final answer to HW2?  I don't have a grade recorded.
